\section{Part 3: Network and Link Layer Analysis (3 pt)}

\subsection{Source/Destination IP: Locate the DNS Query packet sent from your host to the Google DNS server}

\subsubsection{What is the Source IP Address?}





\subsubsection{What is the Destination IP Address?}






\subsubsection{Explain why these Source and Destination IP addresses will remain unchanged as the packet travels across the internet to the Google DNS server.}






\subsection{Find the Time to Live (TTL) field in the IP header of the DNS Query. What does the initial value of the TTL represent, and how does your local router/gateway modify this value when forwarding the packet?}





\subsection{Find the MAC Address of your local router/gateway (either by using arp -a in the command prompt or by finding the MAC address associated with the Gateway IP in your capture)}






\subsection{What are the Source and Destination addresses in the Link Layer header (Ethernet or 802.11)? How are these addresses fundamentally different from the IP addresses you found?}








\subsection{Examine the Link Layer header (Ethernet II or similar). What is the Type field's value, and what does it tell the receiving device (your router/gateway) about the protocol that follows?}
